Weight and Balance calculator for the PocketPC.

Add multiple airplane profiles, and configure the weight and balance station limits for each airplane. Then before each flight, enter the weights for each station, and the program will display your takeoff, landing, and zero-fuel center of gravity in a graphical envelope. A fuel calculator is also included, assuming US weights.
